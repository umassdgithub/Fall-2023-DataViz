## Week 12
### Filed Flow Visualization with Glyphs
#### Glyphs are atomic visual elements that are used to represent one or more number of features of the dataset.
<p>In these examples we will try to make a simple glyph which will
represent the speed and direction of the wind.
For this purpose, using d3js's path function a shape
which is similar to an arrow symbol is made.
</p>
<p>
The direction, scale, color and length of the glyph is set 
by a function. Using this function, we can append a 
glyph object to all or some of the cells of the data
